  <h1>How solve?</h1>
  <div>debug.</div>
  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
  <p>Open this file in Chrome</p>
  <p>Open developer tools</p>
  <p>In the javascript console, play with some_object like:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>some_object.name</li>
      <li>some_object.age</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Notice how much time this can save you to diagnose issues. If a function is broken, put a debugger where you think the issue is and javascript will enter the console from that spot</p>
  <script>
    var some_object = {name: 'John Doe', age: 25}
    debugger;
  </script>
</body>
